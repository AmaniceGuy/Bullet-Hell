# Bullet-Hell
A soundless bullet hell game

If you want to play:
1. download everything
2. make a new folder with the name "Images", and move all folders except "Fonts"
inside it
3. Now you can run the .exe

I have the original python game code in the .py file with the same name as the exe

Note: All art is not mine!
